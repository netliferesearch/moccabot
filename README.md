# Moccabot: Work in progress

Moccabot is built to register the temperature over a coffe maker and post a Slack notification when it's done dripping.

Installing Moccabot

1. Connect the temperature sensor to the board
2. Tweak the threshold temperature and the brewing time
4. Copy .env-example to an .env and insert Slack bot API token
5. Make some damn coffee and never forget the pot again

Equipment

- Tessel 2 (any networked prototyping board will do)
- Temperature sensor (we use the BME280)
- Coffee maker (we use a Moccamaster)
